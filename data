LangChain ‚ÄòMapReduce‚Äô method for large document summarization using LLM
Background:
Text summarization is the process of making short, informative summaries of longer texts while keeping the most important details. Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for summarizing various types of text, like news articles, technical documents, contracts or research papers.

Although summarizing a short paragraph is a trivial task, summarizing large documents such as a PDF file with multiple pages can be challenging. In this blog, we will go through a few examples of how we can use generative models along with LangChain strategies to summarize large documents.

For flexible interactions with LLMs and effective summarization of lengthy documents, utilizing pre-built methods or libraries like LangChain is highly advantageous, especially when they integrate seamlessly with Vertex AI.

Objective
In this blog, we will use LangChain, a framework for developing LLM applications, to apply some summarization strategies like below.

- Stuffing method
- MapReduce method
- Refine method

Tools and technology used while writing the blog:

- Google Cloud Vertex AI PaLM2 API model text-bison which is optimized for performing natural language tasks, such as classification, summarization, extraction, content creation etc.

- LangChain chain modules for documents

Staffing Method:

LangChain ‚ÄòStaffing‚Äô method for large document summarization using LLM
Stuffing is the most straightforward technique for feeding data to a language model. It involves inserting text into the prompt as context, ensuring that the model can process all the necessary information for summarization.

With the stuff method, we can summarize the entire document content with a single API call passing all data at once. Depending on the context length of LLM, the stuff method would not work as it result in a prompt larger than the context length.

400 The request cannot be processed. The most likely reason is that the provided input exceeded the model's input token limit.
Thus, here are the pros and cons of using the stuffing method:

Pros:
Only a single call is required to the model.
The model can access the entire dataset simultaneously when generating a text summary, potentially leading to enhanced summary results.
Cons:
Many models come with a predefined context limit; for instance, text-bison has a maximum input token restriction of 4K. When dealing with large documents , the stuffing technique will not be viable, as it would produce prompts exceeding the context length.
In summary, The stuffing method is typically more effective when applied to smaller data segments and is less suitable for handling large documents.

In the following section, we will explore approaches which designed to help deal with having longer text than context length limit of LLMs.

MapReduce Method:

LangChain ‚ÄòMapReduce‚Äô method for large document summarization using LLM
The `MapReduce` approach is a multi-stage summarization technique. It involves summarizing larger texts by first summarizing smaller sections and then merging those summaries into one cohesive summary. By using the MapReduce method, the model can summarize extensive documents while circumventing the context limitations of the Stuffing method through parallel processing. However, the MapReduce requires multiple calls to the model and potentially losing context between pages.

This method is somewhat more intricate than the initial approach, but it proves to be more effective, especially with large datasets. In this context, we‚Äôll create two prompt templates: one for the initial summarization step and another for the final consolidation step.

Pros:
Capable of summarizing a large document
Compatible with efficient parallel processing, as the summarization processes for different pages operate independently.
Cons:
Multiple calls to the model is needed
Since pages are summarized separately, there is a potential for context loss between them
Refine Method:

LangChain ‚ÄòRefine‚Äô method for large document summarization using LLM
The Refine method offers an alternative approach to handle the summarization of large documents. It begins with an initial prompt applied to a small portion of the data, generating an initial output. Then, as each subsequent document is processed, the output from the prior document is incorporated alongside the new document. The LLM is tasked with refining the output based on the additional content from the new document. This approach ensures a comprehensive and accurate summary, as it considers the context of the previous page.

Here are the pros and cons of using such method:

Pros:
Capable of summarizing a large document
Since the sequential pages are summarized with the context from the preceding pages, the continuity of context between the pages is maintained.
Cons:
Multiple calls to the model is needed
Does not work well with parallel processing as the processes to summarize pages are dependent to each other
Conclusion
We‚Äôve achieved the successful summarization of a lengthy document, overcoming the initial input prompt limit. Furthermore, we‚Äôve acquired insights into various techniques for summarizing extended documents, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks.

As a next step, for a given large document, comparing the text-bison model output with OpenAI or other pre-trained models would be an interesting exercise to understand which model performs best.

And perhaps cost :-)

Would you consider RAG as a method for summarizing documents?
